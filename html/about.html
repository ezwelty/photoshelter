	<h2 class="title">Bio</h2>
	<p>
Born in the '80s. Raised in France. Studied physics and biology at the University of Washington while working as photographer and editor for the school's daily newspaper. Snorkeled rivers to map fish for the U.S. Geological Survey, then tracked tidewater glacier retreat with time-lapse photography for a PhD at the University of Colorado. Now I work at the World Glacier Monitoring Service in ZÃ¼rich, ride trains and bicycles, climb mountains, dabble in fermented foods (and beverages), and photograph my way through the world.

	<p>
I am always looking for opportunities to support worthy causes through my work, whether by donating prints to art auctions or by documenting landscapes under threat. Over the years, I have had the pleasure of supporting the following organizations, raising thousands of dollars with print donations and putting my images of the North Cascades to work for conservation advocacy.
